# About Me:

I am a freelance geek.

I have self taught myself how to design in Fusion 360, how to make PCB's in EAGLE and also help out at The [Making Rooms](https://makingrooms.org/).

My hobbies include:
 - Programming
 - Designing things in fusion 
 - Playing retro games
 - resurrecting old computers
 - other geeky stuff


Check out my Hackaday profile and blog to see some of my crazy creations. (May be empty at the moment but theres more to come, i promise!)
